# Minimal Weather App

<!-- BRIEF -->
This minimal weather app was built for the LinkedIn Group Front End Future Challenge #1, organised by Cameron Blackwood. It was my first project built in TypeScript, completed in one day, and the app is hosted on Vercel.

#### Brief
FRONT END FUTURE TALENT CHALLENGE 1

Your challenge is to use OpenWeather’s Free API to produce a useful B2C weather app! Get as creative as you like, or make it as niche as you want! I’ll judge you on UX, Creativity and of course Code :)

Here is the API (it’s free) - https://openweathermap.org/api

##### Tier 1:

* Make a call to the API and render the information on the screen

##### Tier 2:
* Allow the user to control the calls to the API via different inputs
* Interpret the data somehow (that’s up to you!)
* Deploy your app somewhere (doesn't need to be on a special domain name)

You don't need to spend money for any of these solutions. Look forward to seeing what you make! If you are interested in me doing an in depth review of your submission on my YouTube channel, please let me know.
Closing date is 28 Feb 2023

* Create a .env file using the .env.example file for reference, and create a [free openweathermap account](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get an API key. Add it to the .env file to get the API requests working.
